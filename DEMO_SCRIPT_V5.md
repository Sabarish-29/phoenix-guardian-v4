> "Phoenix Guardian has found 3 patients across different hospitals
> with an identical symptom cluster that has never been classified."

*Click "Report to ICMR"*

> "Every disease humans know about was once unknown.
> Lyme disease — identified because a cluster of children in one
> Connecticut town had the same strange arthritis.
> HIV — identified because the CDC noticed a pattern across cities.
> Both took years of manual observation.
>
> Phoenix Guardian finds these patterns automatically,
> across hospitals, in real time."

*[3:00 — 40 seconds used]*

### [3:00 — CLOSING LINE]

*Slowly close laptop halfway. Look at judges.*

> "We are not building a documentation tool.
>
> Phoenix Guardian speaks for the patients who have no voice.
> It finds the diseases that nobody was looking for.
> It watches what happens after the doctor does everything right.
> And it discovers conditions that have never had a name.
>
> This is not automation.
>
> This is a Guardian."

*[3:30 — done]*

## BACKUP ANSWERS

**Q: "Doesn't Nuance DAX already do this?"**
A: "Nuance DAX generates notes after the appointment. Phoenix Guardian
   speaks during care — and it speaks for patients who can't."

**Q: "How is Ghost Protocol different from normal rare disease search?"**
A: "Rare disease tools search when a doctor already suspects something.
   Ghost Protocol activates when no human is looking — and when the
   symptoms match nothing known. It creates the first record of a
   potentially new disease."

**Q: "What makes the personal baseline different from clinical alerts?"**
A: "Every hospital monitor compares patients to population averages.
   A patient whose normal heart rate is 95 will never trigger an alert.
   We compare patients to themselves — their first two hours in this bed.
   That's a fundamentally different signal."
